# DialogueCreator
Application for writing dialogues for video games. I wrote this like a free analogue of Dialogue Plugin for Unreal Engine 4 (80\$), but this application can be used in any project, cause it import all of the dialogues in simple JSON format.

Some technical details:
Each node has an unique id for finding it, NPC text, and list of answers(text/link). Link is number of nodew hich will be next if this answer is chosen. You can just open your json file and see simply structure of nodes.

Using connection mode you can connect nodes, click on green part of answer and after that click on node to what you want connect that answer


Shortcuts:

Ctrl+A add new node

Ctrl+S save current project

Ctrl+E EXPORT as zip archive

Shift - change mode

Requirements:

1) Python 3.6 or above

2) Kivy
